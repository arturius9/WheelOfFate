
Provided solution consists of 3 projects:

-WebApi part
-UI part (MVC)
-WebApi Unit Tests

SupportWheelsOfFateOnlyWebApi.sln - contains only WebApi and its Unit Test projects
SupportWheelsOfFateOnlyMVC.sln - contains only MVC project
SupportWheelsOfFateAll.sln - contains all 3 projects

Due to lack of time I have skipped unit tests for MVC and also I didn't play with UI creation much to make its look and feel nicer.

How to run:

Option 1:

1. Open SupportWheelsOfFateAll.sln, build and Publish SuppotWheelOfFateWebApi project to IIS.
2. In SuppotWheelOfFateMVC project in appsettings.json update base url to WebApi
3. Build and Publish SupportWheelsOfFateMVC project to IIS.

Option 2:

1. Open SupportWheelsOfFateOnlyWebApi.sln, build and Run WebApi from VS.
2. Open SupportWheelsOfFateOnlyMVC.sln, update base url to WebApi in appsettings.json
3. Build and Run from VS.
